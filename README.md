# Hotel Management Client
This is part of a project, work in progress üõ†Ô∏è, the group currently consits of three people. Two for the Back-End ( .Net). I'm fully taking care of the Front-End.  

The idea for this project is to create an application that would assist the staff of a hotel in managing the establishment.

The project currently consists of three members: two for the Back-End (.NET), and myself, fully responsible for the Front-End.

### Current techologies being used: React, TypeScript, Sass (CSS pre-processor), Zustand and Framer Motion (animation framework)
# Goal
My main goal for this project is to show my improvement in my Front-End tech stack and to implement much better practices than my last project.

Expect images from the project soon.  
While you wait, feel free to run it yourself.
# How to run
1. Navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd hotel-managment
    ```
2. Run the client application in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
Done.

For the latest changes, make sure you've selected a branch that is currently being worked on, of course be aware of bugs.

Also, I do recongnize that there is a spelling mistake in the title üôà, will fix that later...
