# Hotel Management Client
This is part of a project, work in progress üõ†Ô∏è, the group currently consits of three people. Two for the Back-End ( .Net). I'm fully taking care of the Front-End.  

The idea for this project is to create an application that would assist the staff of a hotel in managing the establishment.

## Tech stack:  
* React
* TypeScript
* Sass
* Zustand
* Framer motion
* React testing library
* Vitest
  
# Goal
My main goal for this project is to show my improvement in my Front-End tech stack and to implement much better practices than my last project.
All components are custom made, no component libraries used.

Expect images from the project soon.  
While you wait, feel free to run it yourself.
# How to run
1. Navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd hotel-managment
    ```
2. Run the client application in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
Done.

For the latest changes, make sure you've selected a branch that is currently being worked on, of course be aware of bugs.
